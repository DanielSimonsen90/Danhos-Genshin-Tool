    <h2>The idea</h2>
    <p>
      <span>
        The original idea was to look up artifact pieces and get usable information whether or not to save the artifact piece for a character.
      </span>
      <span>
        Later, it was expanded to more than just a search machine, so you're also able to deep-dive into character sets, artifacts, and domains, with the ability to go back to your search history and save preferences.
