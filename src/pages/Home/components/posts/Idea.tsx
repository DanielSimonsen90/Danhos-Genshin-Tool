        The original idea was to look up artifact pieces and get usable information whether or not to save the artifact piece for a character.
      </span>
      <span>
        Later, it was expanded to more than just a search machine, so you're also able to deep-dive into character sets, artifacts, and domains, with the ability to go back to your search history and save preferences.

        Now, it is more than just an artifact helper, and is well on its way to be a full-fledged Genshin Impact companion. But for now, it's just my little tool to help me guide my Genshin Impact experience.
