  `A flower that resembles a candle lamp, commonly found near water. It emits a cold, simple aroma that ahs a calming effect.\nThe contrasting colors of its stamen and stem are thought to symbolize the two different types of kuuvahki, yet despite this symbolism, it is one of the few rare plants that are immune to kuuvahki's influence. as a result, the Frostmoon Scions sometimes regard it as a symbol of faithlessness and apostasy.\nIt is said that this strangely shaped flower first appeared at the end of the dark calamity 500 years ago, but this claim has never been rigorously verified.`,

  `A silver crystal as pure and pristine as moonlight. It possesses almost perfect elemental affinity.\nIn the legacy of the Frostmoon Scions, these crystals were born five hundred years ago alongside the Moon Maiden, and were believed by the Moonchanter at the time to be a gift from the moon, hence the name "Moonfall Silver".\nHowever, in older documents written by Snezhnayan chroniclers, the descendants of the golden realm were already using secret silver woven by the Frostmoon thousands of years in the past. The threads that connect these two tales are unclear â€” the only certain thing is that these crystals make excellent elemental conductors in the eyes of Nod-Krai's craftspeople.`,

export const PortableBearing = new LocalSpecialty(
  'Portable Bearing',
  `A portable bearing of a type that was mass-produced after the Fatui moved into Nod-Krai. Excessively worn units are discarded like obsolete personnel.\nA few of them have a vestige of kuuvahki left inside. As they are difficult to imitate, they are occasionally used as currency by merchants in Nasha Town.\nIt's said that people tried to forge these bearings for that reason, but went bankrupt in the end because the cost of forging them was higher than their market value.`,
