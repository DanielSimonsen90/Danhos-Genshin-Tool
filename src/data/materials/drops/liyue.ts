But why would a creature so pure and clean as an oceanid covet the appearance of a being that roams the land, and assume such a form with pure water? They need not breathe nor do they require sustenance...`,

They retain pure adeptal energy even after falling off and cannot be damaged by ordinary weapons.\nOrdinary beasts can sometimes be affected by errant adeptal energy and become more powerful than usual. However, a suanni's adeptal energy originates from within themselves, which is why their leader is oftenregarded as equal to adepti.`,
