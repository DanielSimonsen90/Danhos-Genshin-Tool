The passions of those who dance with their blade amid crimson showers must surely be cooled someday by fickle steel.`,
  [Rarity.Uncommon]: `A handguard mounded upon a sword of some distinction.\nInazuma has a long tradition of sword-making. When making swords, smiths will often make several different weapons at once, before choosing from among them the "shinuchi," or the best weapon, while the others are known as "kageuchi."`,
  [Rarity.Common]: `A battle-worn handguard that was once mounted on an Inazuman blade.\nFor those adept in the art of the sword, the tsuba is a defense from the edge of an opponent's blade.\nFor beginners, it is a defense made for their own right hand, to protect it from itself.`,
