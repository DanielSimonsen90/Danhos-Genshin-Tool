Putting the tune inscribed upon the shattered rubble back together, it appears to be a small sliver of a grander musical movement.\nPeople once believed that the song of eternal happiness and harmony would resound throughout the world till the end of all destinies.\nBut harmonies can be changed.\nWhen the rebellious God King fell from his throne, the imperishable capital was reduced to refuse and rubble for whom, then, shall the lyre in the hands of a legion-less commander play?`,

Be they clockwork meka, other Fontemer Aberrants, on hunters with ill-placed curiosity — all have yielded under its power.\nFontemer Aberrants are different from human beings in that the concepts of aristocracy or inheritance are entirely foreign to them. None of them are born superior. One that survives deadly Predators and adversities can accumulate infinite power as it keeps hunting and feeding over centuries. Such a creature is often referred to as an overlord for the fear it inspires.`,

It did not start from a base form before growing larger and stronger, but instead grew limbs and a horn that have no place on an ordinary seahorse. Even its musculature and skeleton have changed. It really seems to resemble a fantastical beast from legends of yore more than its original shape.\nIn the imaginations of poets and authors, even seahorses can frolick upon the earth.`,
