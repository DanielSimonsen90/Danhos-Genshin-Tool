This magnificent king amongst Fungi has been leisurely pacing on the finish line of evolution. Now and then, it emits a long call to all the living beings in the rainforest:\nEven the most helpless and timid creature may one day become the monarch of the woods.`,

Elemental Hypostases, on the contrary, are most distant in appearance to all living beings.\nThe combination of these two should probably never have appeared in this world. It is said that such elemental hypostases have the intelligence to "learn" and have thus understood the colors and dreams of the forest, a process that has transformed them into this shape over thousands of years.`,

It is generally believed that their mimicry of flowers is to lure lost prey caught by sandstorms.\nThere is also a theory, however, that their imitation of a blooming flower was inspired by the splendid blossoms countless epochs ago, which have long gone the way of the desert winds.`,

The mitsudomoe symbol is emblazoned on it as a deliberate show of status and might.\nThis symbol, however, is no show of obeisance to the master of lightning, but is instead a blade pointed at the existing powers that be in this world. Nor is the mirror a means to shut out the looks of judgment from onlooking people, but is rather a bulwark against this base and sullied world. Within this great temple shall punishment be meted out and ignorance be cleansed.\nDreams shall be overturned, desires shall be cut away, and karma shall be reset.`,

For the dragons of old, even if a rose lost its name, it would not lose its scent. Naming things is but how Lesser, ephemeral beings understand the world. Life is not constrained by words, and will always grow and evolve.`,

But for said life, this was fate.\nFollowing the heaven-sent disaster, wood, vines, roots, and all manner of flora withered and turned to dust. A great many life forms disappeared.\nBut in the stillness of amber, a nameless insect endures in this otherworldly oasis, reaching a future that no others of its kind could.`,
