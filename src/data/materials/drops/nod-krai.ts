  `Precision Kuuvahki Stamping Die`,
  `A stamping die taken from the wreckage of a defeated Knuckle Duckle - think of it as a keepsake from Aino.\nA philosopher from Sumeru once argued that self-replication is a unique characteristic of life, an unparalleled achievement that no man-made object can mimic. The power to reproduce is the key that separates mankind from the divine.\nHowever, if a machine is given an exact mold that it can use to replicate itself, mold included, then can not this too be considered perpetual self-replication? The former master of the silent, blue-haired maid who stands by Aino's side once pondered that same question but ultimately dismissed it out of fear that a perpetually self-replicating machine would consume everything on the planet's surface.\nSuch problems have never concerned Aino. This machine will not exhaust the world's resources to multiply itself just yet - after all, it's just a duck.`,

  `Lightbearing Scale-Feather`,
  `The scaly wings shed by a defeated Radiant Moonfly.\nIn many local folk tales, those who enter the forbidden ground are frequently bewitched by these wings and never seen again. Some say this is because the moon, whose illusory magic these butterfly-shaped monsters have harnessed, is prone to inducing madness, while others take it as a warning of the inconstancy and danger of ancient power...`,

  `Radiant Antler`,
  `A fragment of a defeated Frostnight Herra's majestic antlers. Light and razor-sharp, it requires no sharpening to help it slice through metal armor with ease.\nAccording to ancient tales, these beautiful, proud creatures were created by the first emissary.\nWhen Elysium fell, they made a pact with the mistress of the Frost Moon, vowing to use the primal light bestowed by the Frost Moon to cleanse the mortal world's defilement until the patron of old could return once more. Today, these legends' origins are long lost, and their veracity is impossible to prove. Yet the creatures that once walked with the light continue to watch over this land from the shadows, through the long frozen nights and withering black tide alike - none of which could cause their forms to vanish from this world.`,

export const CyclicMilitaryKuuvahkiCore = new MobDrop(
  `Cyclic Military Kuuvahki Core`,
  `A kuuvahki device obtained from the energy core after defeating the Super-Heavy Landrover:\nMechanized Fortress.\nThe Fontaine Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering once defined several ideal cycle patterns for elemental working substance engines. Regardless of the type, the most perfect number of cycles has consistently been four. Although most engineers from the Armory Palace and the Kuuvahki Experimental Design Bureau tend to regard kuuvahki as a working substance distinct from elemental energy, design configurations beyond the four-cycle paradigm have still been proven inefficient and impractical. In a certain sense, the "four"-cycle might be the world's peculiar preference. Although, the world may have no preference at all, and for the world, the habit of presumptuous mortals making self-satisfied conjectures could well be the strangest preference of all.`,

  `A deep-black bone relic taken from the lingering corruption left behind after defeating the Whisperer of Nightmares that came invading from beyond this world.\nThe Formless beast that soared through the starless void should never have required organs this world calls "wings." Those grotesque, profane appendages may have arisen to adapt to the laws beneath the moon, or perhaps they are merely the distorted fragment of its true form that mortal eyes are able to witness.`,

  `A crystallized tail vertebra left behind by a defeated Radiant Moongecko in its attempt to escape.\n
  By all logic, a lizard that has evolved to such formidable strength should no longer face the threat of natural predators. Yet it still retains the instinct to shed its tail in a bid for survival. Perhaps in an age when moonlight blanketed the land, even more terrifying predators once prowled this place.`,

  `A mask found in the heretical testing grounds after defeating the false god that usurped the moon.\nMedicine is meant to cure the ailments of the flesh, yet mortal physicians turn a blind eye to the true causes of death. In the hands of a wise healer, the frail human body escapes the bounds of birth, aging, sickness, and death, revealing strength that defies common sense.`,

  `A band found in the heretical testing grounds after defeating the false god that usurped the moon.\nHumanity defines civilization by driving out madness. Yet believing that all things, whether they exist or not, can be contained within reason may itself be another form of lunacy. The madman sees through reason's cunning, and in his world, all things are permitted.`,

The pursuit of truth should know no bounds — by this measure, those condemned as heretics by the world are the truest seekers of knowledge.`,
