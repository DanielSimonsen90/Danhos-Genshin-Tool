  `A stamping die taken from the wreckage of a defeated Knuckle Duckle - think of it as a keepsake from Aino.\nA philosopher from Sumeru once argued that self-replication is a unique characteristic of life, an unparalleled achievement that no man-made object can mimic. The power to reproduce is the key that separates mankind from the divine.\nHowever, if a machine is given an exact mold that it can use to replicate itself, mold included, then can not this too be considered perpetual self-replication? The former master of the silent, blue-haired maid who stands by Aino's side once pondered that same question but ultimately dismissed it out of fear that a perpetually self-replicating machine would consume everything on the planet's surface.\nSuch problems have never concerned Aino. This machine will not exhaust the world's resources to multiply itself just yet - after all, it's just a duck.`,

Some say this is because the moon, whose illusory magic these butterfly-shaped monsters have harnessed, is prone to inducing madness, while others take it as a warning of the inconstancy and danger of ancient power...`,

  `A fragment of a defeated Frostnight Herra's majestic antlers. Light and razor-sharp, it requires no sharpening to help it slice through metal armor with ease.\nAccording to ancient tales, these beautiful, proud creatures were created by the first emissary.\nWhen Elysium fell, they made a pact with the mistress of the Frost Moon, vowing to use the primal light bestowed by the Frost Moon to cleanse the mortal world's defilement until the patron of old could return once more. Today, these legends' origins are long lost, and their veracity is impossible to prove. Yet the creatures that once walked with the light continue to watch over this land from the shadows, through the long frozen nights and withering black tide alike - none of which could cause their forms to vanish from this world.`,
