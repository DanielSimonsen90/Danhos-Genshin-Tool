However the waves conjured by the Hydro Hypostasis are incompatible with the currents that flow above and below ground.\nEven if it were to flow into the surpassingly pure waters of Petrichor, this drop of water will likely resist assimilation as strongly as mercury.`,

Because of their great hatred for man-made light sources, these vishaps will lose any visual acuity by the time they reach maturity.\nAt the same time, they have also evolved a certain degree of elemental polymorphism for combat purposes.`,
