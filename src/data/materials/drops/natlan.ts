  `Overripe Flamegranate`,
  `A strange Flamegranate obtained after defeating the Gluttonous Yumkasaur Mountain King.\nNormally, Flamegranates that keep growing once they have already ripened simply fall into the mud and rot. But Flamegranates that have fallen from the Mountain King's mane, perhaps owing to the unique internal temperature conditions, exhibit a rarely-seen "Overripe" state. Flamegranates in this state are stable, phlogiston-packed, brightly colored, and possess a rich and highly distinctive flavor.`,

  `Mark of the Binding Blessing`,
  `A horn fragment obtained after defeating the Goldflame Qucusaur Tyrant.\nA strange mark known as the "Flamelord's Blessing" extends out across its surface. Saurians that bear this mark are said to wield an ancient power of terrible potency.\nYet given their slighter statures, this power is too great a burden for the Saurians of the present day to bear. As such, it has been the cause of much calamity, and many tragedies have stemmed from the uncontrollable power it has unleashed.`,

export const GoldInscribedSecretSourceCore = new MobDrop(
  `Gold-Inscribed Secret Source Core`,
  `This is a core component that separated from the body fo a Secret Source Automaton: Configuration Device that lost its ability to move after being defeated.\nSome say that the cores that power all the Secret Source Automatons are the same type, and that they simply carry different information, as attested by the fact that the golden patterns on them are different. At first, many commands were only added to the circuits to aid their smooth running, but it seems that all the superimposition and layering of orders onto one another has wound up creating a rudimentary artificial intelligence.`,

  `Ensnaring Gaze`,
  `An object obtained after defeating the monster known as the Tenebrous Papilla. It may look like a piece of fruit, but it is not.\nFormed from energy that has condensed in a single spot, its "eye" seems to gaze out from a distant, dark otherworld.`,

  `Talisman of the Enigmatic Land`,
  `A talisman that somehow appeared in your inventory after you passed the Wayward Hermetic Spiritspeaker's test.\nIn some records kept by the Masters of the Night-Wind, priests masterful in Spiritspeaking can use meditation to pass their consciousness through the light and shadow that reflects offal obsidian, thus reaching the enigmatic underground realm that only the dead may enter. This deed is, however, perilous, and priests who perform it must often wear such talismans to guard their souls from being lost in that mysterious land. However, this talisman's symbolic value far outstrips its real effects. Perhaps the hermit-priest who grants this to a warrior who passes the test only does so as a simple blessing.`,

  `A core pulled from the blazing remains of the Lava Dragon Statue.\nIt is said that the entity known as the Lava Dragon Statue is a special existence born from the limitless accumulation of Phlogiston.\nOriginally, it was believed that pure energy would produce a being with human-like intelligence.\nHowever, this attempt ultimately failed. Unlike in ancient times, it seems that pure energy can no longer naturally give rise to complex, intelligent, and controllable organisms capable of growth.`,

It is no longer active.\nIt may once have been designed to allow all manner of objects to escape the bonds of celestial bodies before being trialed in the Source Mechanisms. If everything had gone smoothly, this technology might, in time, have been applied to more important areas...`,
