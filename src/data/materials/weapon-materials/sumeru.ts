    [Rarity.Uncommon]: `Under the instructions of the First Sage, the ancestors of the forest people made these talismans using withered trees to commemorate the Lord of Verdure.\nThe talisman's shape was inspired by the forest dew. It symbolizes the permeation of wisdom into mortal minds.`,
    [Rarity.Rare]: `Later, the Lord of Verdure taught people the mystery of the forging of black iron. The innocent mortals thus grasped the knowledge of using fire to forge blades.\nThe Lord of Verdure took pleasure in their knowledge — Lethal as fire and blades were to her, they made ordinary people powerful.`,
    [Rarity.Epic]: `In the myriad lore of the forest, the one in the striped cape that resembled blazing flames was the Greater Lord of the Labyrinths and the Owner of the Moon-Mirrored Spring.\nWhen he bowed his head and struck up a friendship with the Lord of Verdure, the tokens of their friendship were the gems that glimmered like water and silver that gleamed like the moonlight.\nTo repay such a gesture, the Lord of Verdure promised to keep secrets for the Greater Lord of the Labyrinths and safeguard the intricate and beautiful dreams of the rainforest.\nNo one could have foretold that the magnificent mansion of secrets and dreams would later fade away amidst the shroud of the dark flame of oblivion, after which its ash returned to the soil and became nutrients for the virgin rainforests.`,
    [Rarity.Legendary]: `"Mortals hold dear three things only: the spring water that embraces the moonlight, verdant life, and ageless youth...\nThe nature of "wisdom" is not domination over all minds or scheming to gain all the benefit.\nInstead, it is about empowering even ordinary beings to one day overcome their imposed constraints.\nThough the roar of the tiger is no longer heard in the forest and the resilient guardians would seclude themselves within the dreams of children... On the night when every secret golden seal is lifted and all dreams glow like amber in the moonlight, perhaps she and her beloved people will eventually win genuine freedom.`,

    [Rarity.Uncommon]: `People used to say that the Lord of Flowers was the Lord of Joy and Happiness. Freshwater sprang from her sleeves, and thus was the oasis of blossoming flowers born in the desert. Flowers and grasses followed in her footsteps, and gleaming moonlight cleared the way for her.\nIn the bitter days when the sky turned its back on the ground, the Lord of Flowers extended her merey to each and every one of the mortals, letting them regain their happiness and egos, allowing leisure and luxury to resume.`,
    [Rarity.Rare]: `In the literature buried deep beneath the yellow sands, the Lord of Flowers was the Mistress of Dreams.\nShe bestowed dreams upon the exiled, the manic, and the foolish.\nIn those dreams, they were presented with their dearest delights. Burdened by the brutality of reality, they were fascinated by the charm of the Lord of Flowers and captivated by her beauty and care.`,
    [Rarity.Epic]: `The Lord of Flowers was in an amicable relationship with the Jinn.\nThe Mistress of Flowers and Oases joined hands with the Lord of Deserts and built Ay-Khanoum, the "City of Amphitheaters," which carried the meaning of "City of the Moon Maiden" in the ancient language of the Jinn.\nLater, however, it was said that the Lord of Flowers died due to the malice of the burning sun and yellow sand, after which the blossoms of purple Padisarahs were never seen again in the oases.\nAfter the departure of the Lord of Flowers, the sandstorms keened, the Jinn sobbed, and the moonlight-silver gem disc lost its original, glad purpose, giving off a mournful glimmer.`,
    [Rarity.Legendary]: `Who would worship a departed god?"\nThe Lord of Flowers was once in alliance with two other gods. Apart from wisdom and power, she also brought mercy and joy to her people.\nJust as the earth needs more than the burning sunshine and pouring rain, to the people of the Lord of Flowers, joy and love, singing and music, and wine and extravagance were just as vital as strength and sensibility.\nIt is said that flowers blossom so that they may enjoy a spectacular death, and that death was precisely the wholehearted pursuit of the Lord of Flowers — for death adds bitterness to lost joy, and intensifies with time across endless memories.\nThe ignorant Lord of Deserts was never aware of her reasoning. He only reveled in her immense charm and grace — and as misguided as such fervent affections might be, they were well within the calculations of the Lord of Flowers.`,

    [Rarity.Uncommon]: `A long time ago, the people of the Lord of Deserts carved these imperial insignias based on robust beetles to memorialize the bright sun that marked the shifting of day and night, as well as the infinity of such times.\nThough the name of that Lord is no longer mentioned, these imperial insignias have been preserved through time, each bearing a faint ambiance of those past glories.\nThese insignias travel with the descendants of the Eremite Tribe, silently telling the tales of their then-Lord.`,
    [Rarity.Rare]: `To weave together myriad thoughts and reign over countless souls - this is the essence of power.\nHowever, power is not cold-blooded tyranny. Its true ideal, at its heart, is to create a utopia free of worry, schemes, and slavery.\nIt was just as the silent lord saw in the crystal's secrets, and just as the lost companion had once taught.\nThe dark insect insignia and the steel judgment thus laid the foundations of the kingdom's rules.`,
    [Rarity.Epic]: `Silver moonlight and clear springs once completed the scenery of the oases. But as the Lord of Flowers faded in the darkening sandstorm, so was the worriless golden paradise submerged by death.\nIn the poetry of the Eremite Tribe, the moon cast its silver light on the crimson mantle, causing Al-Ahmar, the Mourning King, to be driven to madness.\nIn a melancholic desert ballad, driven by the haunting nostalgia, the lonely king created an ever-youthful dreamland in the center of the desert, where undisturbed water sprang up and perpetual dusk remained.`,
    [Rarity.Legendary]: `In the era when the ignorant Lord of Deserts ruled, his power descended upon every inch of the land like the scorching sun.\nAncient stone tablets record that he turned his power into seven rays of blinding light or seven pillars, which he granted equally and mercifully to everyone. No one was neglected, nor was anyone discontented.\nThat was a forgotten golden era, an era when the Lord of Flowers had faded into the sands and the Lord of Verdure was determined to leave. Only the descendants in the yellow sand chose to follow their god. Even as the grim shadow of calamity loomed, the power in which they had faith shone brightly like amber and gold.\nYet calamity befell nonetheless, and the golden insectoid insignias were buried beneath the depths of shrine and palace, under collapsed pillars engraved with images of eagles and bulls.`,
