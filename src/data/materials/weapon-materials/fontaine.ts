    [Rarity.Uncommon]: `A harp with rotten keys. Its voice blocked, it cannot be played nor its sound heard.\nIt is said the descendants of the forgotten music once lacquered mechanical wooden harps with gold in order to revive the magnificent remnants of the ancient dynasty, futilely attempting to match them to the silent golems...\nA long time passed, and then more, and the rotten, off-key harps remained in the grasp of those silent giants, caressed by the waves, playing only sorrowful strains.`,
    [Rarity.Rare]: `Legends say that the survivors of that ancient dynasty once cast a harp out of black iron to commemorate and mourn.\nA harp cast of black iron cannot be played. To mourn that ancient dynasty that was once so proud of its golden music, those remaining forged this heavy instrument and its yet weightier silence.\nBut no matter what, the black iron harp remained as silent as that lost era.`,
    [Rarity.Epic]: `In that great disaster, the golden palace sank with its throne, the music was shattered, the notes turned to silence...\nBut the remnants of that empire never gave up their desire for salvation and to surpass fate.\nTo save their waning civilization and their desire to transcend, the Golden Troupe played melodies most wondrous, enticing children to offer their precious souls to the sleeping golems.`,
    [Rarity.Legendary]: `The God King's Grand Symphony is composed of countless melodies linked together, but its main thesis is submerged under the common destiny of the Water Nation.\nThe harmonies of those carefree years and sonatas were once the greatest representation of civilization and order, but when the prosperous empire descended into a playground for tyrants, the brutal despots tore the connection with the source asunder under the cover of golden cloaks, and discord finally swarmed through the empire—\nThe original song of fate continued to ring out on a score of fading gold, unperturbed by all... until all was dissolved, and all returned to chaos.`,

    [Rarity.Uncommon]: `Legends say that before the birth of life, there was a dense primordial sea. It is the purest origin of all things, and one day, it will also swallow all life... and those things which did not arise from it will be filtered out, becoming naught but floating detritus.\n"The existence of detritus also has meaning — What kind of thing would be rejected by the source of all things that swallows all life?" the young Harmost asked the great usurper, pondering this conundrum.`,
    [Rarity.Rare]: `"Life that came from the primordial sea is inevitably fated to return to it." Thus spoke the Harmost Boethius. "But there are infinite possibilities for humans to transcend, and even the waters of the primordial sea cannot completely dissolve them..." The arrogant usurper once attempted to mix insoluble Ichor with pure water, to contain wisdom and memories, allowing his subjects and servants to discard their physical bodies, and obtain independent, eternal lives. But the pain of severing soul and body cannot be endured by any ordinary life, and the usurper's order tore apart and shattered souls.\nThe Ichor was dyed black by the crying and howling of so many souls, and it lost its harmony and wisdom, leaving only chaos and madness.`,
    [Rarity.Epic]: `This is a relic from a time when the Lochknights still roamed - the knights said, there were still loyal spirits in the mountain springs and valleys where none tread, guarding those pure, unpolluted springs....\nHowever, the creator of artificial Ichor couldn't tolerate any discord in his great symphony. It is said that wherever the Harmost Boethius went, the natural nectar was buried, the aqueducts of the empire were built, and the spirits born of pure water vanished without a trace...`,
    [Rarity.Legendary]: `A dense and pure solution, derived and refined from drops of the vast primordial sea. The ancient God King once believed it would bring eternal life and infinite wisdom, but listening carefully— it was quietly, faintly prophesizing the final end of all dissolving into one.\nThis was once the God King's unfinished Grand Symphony — a boundless, sourceless golden Ichor replacing the wild primeval waters, and the glorious immortal sages bringing nectar-like enlightenment to the ignorant corners of the world.\nBut the God King's delusions ultimately sank into the depths of the black abyss, and with the ravages of time, the golden Ichor was eventually corroded by the primordial soup...\nThe tuner turned a blind eye to the evil omens, and supporting his broken body, continued to give life to his compatriots according to the plans once laid, so that the old order might one day return...\nEven today, many mad poets and painters of Fontaine see the apocalypse experienced by Boethius, a reminder of the inescapable cycle of the world.`,

    [Rarity.Uncommon]: `Legend says that when the first usurper came to the primordial sea, the first sovereign gave him a goblet of water.\nLater, he became the unquestioned god-king, and used this goblet of water to refine the mysterious drops of dew, establishing a splendid and powerful empire.\nBut that is now an ancient story, whose main characters now sleep in the phosphorescence of the schools of the deepwater fish.`,
    [Rarity.Rare]: `What kind of empire can last for a thousand years? After returning from the kingdom of dragons, the usurper once pondered this question.\nCombining the immortal stone with the Ichor essence extracted from primordial water, and carved into a race as black as iron - with arcane lithos for skin and Ichor for blood, never again fearing the curse of returning to the primeval past...\nThe silent golem still dreams the dream of the empire - not knowing it has been over a thousand years since the empire's obliteration.`,
    [Rarity.Epic]: `In the years when the golden shroud covered the land, pure spring water had to be hidden away in concealed mountain streams, and the Lochknights were born in these sanctuaries.\nThe knights swear by armor of silver, to protect the spirits born from pure water, to protect their fellows who also keep faith in the one true font, resisting the omnipresent golden power that blotted out the sky and outshone the sun.\nBut that is an ancient legend... Not long after the empire collapsed and sank, the knights who resisted the usurper shed their armor, and their stories were hidden in a tangled web of stories and ballads.`,
    [Rarity.Legendary]: `When the Usurper of the sunken city played the last movement of the golden symphony, the favored musician stole the golden goblet brimming with Ichor.\nShocked by the foolhardy betrayal of the God King, the musician summoned the last guards, and used the insoluble Ichor to seal the dragon beneath the tall tower, and sank into the abyss with the capital.\nAfterwards, this noble thief vanished silently from history, and only the "Golden Troupe" faithfully remembers his prophecy.`,
