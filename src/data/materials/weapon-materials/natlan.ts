    [Rarity.Uncommon]: `According to ancient tribal tradition, all that a person takes comes from this world — so naturally, all that they gain shall also be given back to it.`,
    [Rarity.Rare]: `After the original civilizations crumbled like shattered jade — and those envoys from the skies above, under whose guidance the earthly civilizations had thrived, were devoured by the awakened dragons - humanity plunged into savagery, losing the ability to perceive the world anew.\nThus did they revert to their most primal beliefs, convinced of the inherent mystery of the earth that nurtured all things. This marked the dawn of the era where hunted prey began to be offered as sacrifices.`,
    [Rarity.Epic]: `It is said that the Sage of the Stolen Flame, after imparting the secret knowledge of the mastery of flames in all their many forms to the tribespeople, hoped that they would climb the ladder of civilization and abandon the wrongful practices of their forebears.\nYet dogma deeply entrenched is difficult indeed to shake, and the now empowered youngsters instead ignited conflicts within their own tribes merely for the sake of more offerings. This may explain the sage's eventual disillusionment and withdrawal from history.\nNotably, it was precisely during the reign of the Sacred Lord of the ineffable city that the practice of offering live sacrifices was banned outright. Though the Sacred Lord's true motivation for abolishing many of their customs was the consolidation of authority, this particular act might also be seen as the start of a new kind of civilization.`,
    [Rarity.Legendary]: `"If you wish to possess all that the world has to offer, you must first offer all you have to the world." After the Sacred Lord of the ineffable city forbade the people from praying to the Night Kingdom, the spiritual bonds that had once been established fell into ruin.\nThe scarlet-eyed youth, guided through numerous trials, now faced his final test: to emulate the first human to ascend and confront his own demise by offering up his heart with a golden dagger.\nSelf-sacrifice was seen as an honor reserved for the victor — and thus, without even a moment's hesitation, he sliced open his chest with the gleaming blade.\nIn the end, his sacrifice received the response it deserved, and he was able to return from the kingdom where water flows as rays of light to set out upon a grand new endeavor.`,

    [Rarity.Uncommon]: `It is said that the controversial mastermind who later came to be known as the Sacred Lord of the ineffable city was once imprisoned.\nThe first human to ascend, who at the time had not yet attained divine form, showed him great compassion.\nThus, after emerging from the mighty wing-shadows of a once-great race, he was accepted by the tribe who had once been his.\nSince then, he has concealed his true visage beneath a mask, hiding the golden patterns that mark it, and resolved to offer up everything to the master who holds his vow.`,
    [Rarity.Rare]: `During the war with the dragons, that mastermind of all the tribes the same one who had hidden his face behind a mask — deciphered the golden patterns on the non-human ruins for the warriors.\nThe knowledge with which he did so is now long lost.\nIt was from their enemies that he learned the language and thought patterns required to do this. For him, wielding these skills against them was perhaps a deeply satisfying act of revenge.\nYet his unconcealed hatred for them was a recurring cause of great concern among his fellow heroes.`,
    [Rarity.Epic]: `It was in that era that the first human to ascend arose from the throne to enter the Sacred Flame, while the mortal world awaited the arrival of their successor.\nIt was also the era that the mastermind took up the reins of all authority in their stead.\nUnfortunately, this self-proclaimed Sacred Lord, this usurper who believed that the god he had loved and shed golden tears for should forever remain the one and only — overstepped his authority. Placing selfish desire above the commandments left by that revered god, he established a city in which the heavens and the earth were separated from one another.`,
    [Rarity.Legendary]: `The Sacred Lord of the ineffable city often murmured non-human languages in his dreams, and when he beheld himself in the mirror, he saw how the single pupil that was visible through his mask was gradually becoming vertical. This only served to further fuel his growing hatred for the dragons.\nIt is said that when the scarlet-eyed youth burned down that city above a city, submerged in shadow as it was, he witnessed a half-human figure before the royal hall who had been driven mad. As if tearing off its very face, it ripped away at its indelible divine visage, revealing gaping holes that were fearsomely draconic.\nConsumed by the golden flames it spewed, the disfigured form of that deranged soul fell from a great height into the pitch-black mire below. Forsaken by all, thus was the tragic end that this delusional outcast is said to have met.`,

    [Rarity.Uncommon]: `In ancient times, shamans, priests, or those known as mystics were always on the hunt for methods by which they could communicate with the silent underground realm.\nEver since the Wayob gradually began to manifest, reacting to the resonance between the lone hero and the Nightsouls, this had been so. Entrancement, disembodiment, and theurgy were the main methods they chose, each accomplished through the aid of meticulously polished ritual tools.`,
    [Rarity.Rare]: `Ancient psychics believed that the Wayob, as formless entities of consciousness, were beings stripped of externality and thus the closest thing to the essence of the spirit.\nThe process of polishing rough stones until all texture had been removed, turning them into mirrors of pure light, was also seen as a ritual for removing the surface representations of worldly phenomena. Perhaps the reflections that these psychics saw upon the smooth surface of the mirrors were projections of their own spirits...`,
    [Rarity.Epic]: `When intangible spirits attach themselves to objects, they merge and transform into various forms through a process known as spiritual fusion. Once this has taken place, these spirits are capable of conveying dreamlike visions to humans in a state of trance.\nIt fell upon those who frequently engaged in such dialogues with the spirits to interpret these vision-like dreams, translating omens from beneath the earth into language that could be understood by the tribe, or transforming their warnings into stories. It is said that this is the origin of the tribal storytellers, and also why most outstanding storytellers hail from the Night-Wind.`,
    [Rarity.Legendary]: `Regardless of how they are polished, representations of worldly matter cannot be made to transcend their physical nature - they will always remain material in essence. Similarly, pure human spirit can neither be expressed solely through the "tree" of intention, nor embodied through obsidian mirrors that need constant polishing. As the power of the Night Kingdom and the Nightsouls grew, so too did the types of objects that could be used for spiritual fusion. Eventually, the Wayob came to be capable of conveying revelations of the Night Kingdom through various thoughts alone, dispensing of the need for devotees to perform the ritual of polishing stones into mirrors. Thus were such ritual tools rendered obsolete.`,
