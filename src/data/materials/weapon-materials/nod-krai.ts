    [Rarity.Uncommon]: `An intricate device once known as the "Seven Tools of the Great Thief." Rumors claim it was created by the legendary thief, Reed Miller.\nJust as the first Treasure Hoarders came from all walks of life, this combination of tools meant for different purposes was designed to break down artificial boundaries, regardless of whether they were chains or borders.\nIt should be noted that there are more than seven tools, its just that people are accustomed to using seven to describe anything numerous. Perhaps it is for the same reason that the world is believed to have only seven forms of order.`,
    [Rarity.Rare]: `Just as the legendary thief's tools have been imitated by countless others, so has his name.\nIn a sense, it was not the people who thirsted for something more who stole Reed Miller's name, but rather Reed Miller who stole the identity that was originally theirs alone. These viewpoints are just two sides of the same coin.`,
    [Rarity.Epic]: `Word on the street is that the legendary thief, Reed Miller, has been sentenced to death several times, yet he's always managed to escape at the last minute with the help of his friends — and his tools.\nIn some versions of these stories, several of his followers willingly died in his place for their revered King of Elysium. Naturally, these versions can't compete with the more popular drunken stories full of romance and bliss. Since there has never been a shackle that could restrain the legendary thief, it is only natural to assume that no ending could do the same.`,

If you, too, have wept in the night at the plight of your neighbors!"\n"If you, too, have longed for a shelter from fear! If you, too, have dreamed of a world where no tears are shed!"\n"Then join us, your brothers and sisters, in breaking the chains of slavery!"\n"Let the dead bury the dead, for you will rise up, and with the treasures of the haughty, we will build an Elvsium without boundaries!"`,

    [Rarity.Uncommon]: `In earthly poetry, light is often a metaphor of hope. The fires burn out in silence, only to reveal the onward path in the darkness before dawn.\nRegardless, neither the first Torchforger nor the friend with whom he painted Elysium as a child ever knew where the illuminated path would lead until the moment the lights were extinguished.`,
    [Rarity.Rare]: `Lighting a lamp can dispel darkness, and so the people of the borderlands believed that as long as the lamps of the Lightkeepers were lit, the home of the living would be free of evil spirits.\nThe warriors who had sworn to watch over the night believed the same. That is why, like moths to a flame, man faced a mountain of evil clad in armor to protect his fragile flesh.\nUntil the black tide consumes his flesh, or his flesh devours the black tide, the two cannot be told apart.`,
    [Rarity.Epic]: `The insignia of the Lightkeepers is a nightingale holding a burning wick in its beak.\nIt is said that in the past, the nightingale insignia belonged to a renowned noble house in the northern kingdom. In the shadow untouched by light, a boy, who would become a legendary thief, carved his first raven insignia with his friend in imitation of the nightingale.\nBut that was many years ago.\nNowadays, the raven insignia can be seen everywhere, but the nightingale that the raven once looked up to still dwells on its tower, lamenting the winter city to the light.`,
    [Rarity.Legendary]: `In the long years when the night grasped the land, the first Torchforger lit the flames that dispelled the darkness and swore vigilance against the black tide, so earning the royal ediet that established the Lightkeepers, Unlike the Marechaussee Hunters of the high seas, the Lightkeepers who patrolled the night did not possess any ancient techniques from a lost empire, or prestigious titles and ranks. All they could rely on was weak flesh clad in silver armor, the swords and lamps in their hands, and an ancient oath passed down through generations.\nNo matter how many souls perish beneath the dim light, the dark disaster cannot overturn mortal resolve - for the long night can only steal life, and not the dawn that will eventually rise.`,

    [Rarity.Uncommon]: `It is told that in the years before the country of gold and white stone sank, the moon-worshipping ancestors were guided by the star of dawn to build a tower reaching to the heavens.\nLater on, the most transgressive of wild fantasies, one to unify life and the world into one, one that even the monarch who ruled all nations on earth failed to achieve, was toppled along with the city in the wrath of the high heavens.\nThe homeless survivors fled to the south by the waning light of the Frostmoon, chanting in tears of a glory that belonged to them millennia ago.`,
    [Rarity.Rare]: `The grand city of gold and white stone was no more. Following the moonlight's pale guidance, its exiled inhabitants wandered to a desolate foreign land.\nThe glory and prowess of the past had dried up like morning dew, yet the earliest delusion still flowed beneath the skin of the proud, unlike the graves now lost to time.\nLike farmers breeding their crops, the Archpriestesses who served the moonlight, for generation after generation, selected the purest bloodlines closest to their progenitors, no matter the cost...`,
    [Rarity.Epic]: `A blade as pure as moonlight is the compassion of a benevolent hand.\nIn the name of mercy, all beings offer hope for tomorrow. Even those looking to be made whole can feel the moonlight's pristine blessing flowing beneath their skin.\nEven the smallest blessings, accumulated, can guide the pious scions immersed in them closer to the coming Elysium.\nAll sins and wicked thoughts are cleansed by the pristine moonlight, all tears and suffering are necessary sacrifices — at least that is what the people who worship the moon once firmly believed.`,
    [Rarity.Legendary]: `With the unblessed birth of the prophesied son, a millennia-long plan ushered in a bleak twilight.\nA scheme born of cunning was shattered by foolish betrayal. The youth who was supposed to be king took the maid who was supposed to serve him and stole the secret treasure that was supposed to be his, only to reject the crowns that fate had ordained for him.\nIn time, the king who was destined to rule Elysium went down in history as an unpardonable thief, and by the time the true new moon shone upon the land, the far north's final wish of golden grandeur had already been buried by a priestess, who had never believed in any god, in the empty grave of her king.`,
