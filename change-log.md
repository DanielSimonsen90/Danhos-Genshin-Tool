# 🎉 Danho's Genshin Tool v . 2.2.0 🎉

## Reworked Recommended Weapons
* Moves signature weapon into the tabbar
* More accurately recommends weapons based on internal calculation score (functions like Artifact Helper)

## Updates
* Added "Off-field Damage" tag to Columbina

## Fixes
* Recommended weapons not consistently rendering tabs as rarity hierarchy
* Wolf-Fang being marked as "Rare" instead of "Epic"
* Nod-Krai filter not being in SearchableMobList
* Sigewinne's bonus talents not showing off-field damage
* Toukabou Shigure marked as Legendary, when it should be Epic
* Fungal Nucleus rarities being incorrect
