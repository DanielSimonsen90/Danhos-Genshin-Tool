# 🎉 Danho's Genshin Tool v . 2.1.13 🎉

## Added
* Added Teyvat regions to artifacts - including the filter in SearchableArtifactList.
* Traveler passive talents

## Updates
* The Doctor (Dottore)'s description since I've now played through the archon quest :D
* Artifact set usage percentages of all characters
* Searchable lists in Materials needing scroll... there's no need for that.

## Fixes
* The Doctor (Dottore)'s weekly boss drops marked as "Rare" instead of "Legendary"
* Percentage values in all refinement iterations - now goes back to % value only included at end refinement value
* An issue with text overflowing in single lines
* Mob drops not being aligned
