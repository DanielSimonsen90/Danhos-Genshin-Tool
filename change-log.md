* Styling issues including text overflow on MobCard + decreasing the size of "Boss" tags.
* "Skip Nav" button being multiple lines on shorter widths.

* Festering Desire's secondary stat being "Elemental Mastery" instead of "Energy Recharge"
* Rainbow Serpent's Rain Bow's name having an apostrophe between Rain and Bow.
* Tierlist items being able to move without the context menu visible.
* Search input in the tierlist not being focused using ctrl + f.
* Moving a tierlist entry using searched filter moving the wrong item

## Updates

* Data page includes more models on short display but will always slice results.
* Settings modal has been redesigned.
* SearchableArtifactList now supports "Talent Increase" filter to easily find artifacts that boost talents.
